[templates]
# NOTE: prefer '' over "" for paths, avoids escaping.
# template: A RELATIVE path that points to `~/.config/wallust/template` (depends on platform)
# target: ABSOLUTE path in which to place a file with generated templated values.
# ¡ If either one is a directory, then both SHOULD be one. !
